Changes the color of the light emitted by the Dverger circlet to white. Adds several beam width options, and a pool of radiance (point light) option.

## Configuration
Press "[" (left bracket) to narrow the beam and "]" (right bracket) to widen the beam. At maximum width, the beam turns into a point light centered on the player. Hotkeys, beam color, and beam values are all configurable.

## Installation:
Install with [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)
Copy the ImprovedDvergerCirclet.dll file in the "files" folder to your BepInEx plugins folder.
