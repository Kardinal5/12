## Helheim Notes

- Create world at Helheim level, can't change existing world
- Store "Helheim" and "HelheimLevel{X}" in the GlobalKeys of the world
- If you go to a Valheim world with a character that's been in Helheim, you get Helheim Sickness for 30 minutes (?) that doesn't go away automatically, even if you come back to Helheim
- Helheim sickness gives you -80% health regen and stamina regen, and -100 carry weight

Suggestions:
- Helheim could take advantage of CLLC level up by zone, if a player kills certain volume of enemies in zone they can be taken to helheim. IE: Once you have triggered enough kills in zone your env changes to different helheim levels and you are to fight a mini boss choice after X kills or similar strategy. 
- Helheim can coexist with a Valheim world, it could occur as above. You can even take hold of zones in the world and designate them as Helheim level up areas so you would have to face relentless mobs in this area with each level up offering a higher roll chance on loot
- Helheim can totally lend to this "dungeon crawler" concept just imagine the crawling happening in heavily wooded areas in Black Forest or in those random empty spots in the meadows etc.
